Welcome to the **[unofficial platform for custom web applications powered by OpenAI APIs](https://maxinexiong-openai-api-web-apps-home-xbxlm8.streamlit.app/)**! This repository hosts 
a collection of web applications deployed on *[Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)*. These applications leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's powerful language models to provide 
unique functionalities. Currently, the platform includes three web applications:

### Talk to GPT-3.5 [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://maxinexiong-openai-api-web-apps-home-xbxlm8.streamlit.app/Talk_To_GPT3.5) 

The first web application, **[Talk to GPT-3.5](https://maxinexiong-openai-api-web-apps-home-xbxlm8.streamlit.app/Talk_To_GPT3.5)**, is an interactive chatbot application that allows users to 
communicate with the model using text messages or speech input. Powered by OpenAI's **Whisper model** for speech-to-text conversion and the **gpt-3.5-turbo model** for generating high-quality 
responses, this application offers a conversational experience similar to interacting with a human expert. Users also have the option to play the bot's responses in audio format, enhancing 
the conversational experience with a greater sense of immersion and realism. Additionally, the application provides a variety of built-in prompts that assign roles or personas to the chatbot, 
providing an effective starting point for each type of conversation, and ensuring that the chatbot will produce the desired responses in an efficient manner.

The second web application, **[CodeMaxGPT](https://maxinexiong.github.io/intro-codemaxgpt.html)**, is designed to provide coding assistance to programmers. Built on OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model, 
it is specifically tuned and optimized to cater to the diverse needs of developers, including code generation, debugging, refactoring, and documentation. The platform provides auto-prompts 
for the GPT model based on various use cases that a user may select. It also features a more user-friendly interface compared to the original [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), allowing users to comfortably enter or 
paste code and even upload code scripts directly from their local computer. With its user-friendly interface, advanced auto-prompting features, and seamless code uploading capabilities, 
**[CodeMaxGPT](https://maxinexiong.github.io/intro-codemaxgpt.html)** is the ultimate coding companion. Whether you're a junior developer tackling complex programs or a seasoned pro exploring 
new languages or frameworks, **[CodeMaxGPT](https://maxinexiong.github.io/intro-codemaxgpt.html)** has you covered.

### DALL·E Image Generator (Unavailable)
